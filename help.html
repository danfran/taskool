    <strong>Taskool</strong> is a simple task planner and to-do list app that helps you to create and schedule tasks
    with a straightforward interface. It does not require any registration or login process.

    If the app is launched for the first time, a permission popup is displayed

    Click <strong>Allow</strong> to enable the app to send you notification based on your schedule.
</p>
<p>
    Once the top-right cross-button is pressed, a popup form for creating your task will appear.

    This form allows you to either create a new task or modify an existing one.
    The <strong>Title</strong> field is mandatory and represents the name of your task displayed on the main list.
    It is not necessary to provide the task's details, although it can be a convenient way to display additional information related to the task itself.
    Clicking the <i>Next</i> button at the bottom right will take you to the next page,
    while the <i>Back</i> button will return you to the previous page.
